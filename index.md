# ZACOW

## ZACOW is an online, self-paced program designed to help students in the USACO Silver Division, although there are some resources pertaining to the Bronze Division. Getting from the USACO Silver Division to the Gold Division is getting much harder in recent years and this program aids in this goal!


## The current head of ZACOW is Rithwik Gupta!
