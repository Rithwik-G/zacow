# ZACOW

## ZACOW is an online, self-paced program designed to help students in the USACO Silver Division, although there are some resources pertaining to the Bronze Division. Getting from the USACO Silver Division to the Gold Division is getting much harder in recent years and this program aids in this goal!

## The current head of ZACOW is Rithwik Gupta!

## Applications for ZACOW open on August 13th and close on August 31st.

### The application is a list of past USACO and codeforces problems which should take no more than a couple of hours to complete! You will need to submit your code solution (comments not required) and screenshots proving that you have solved these problems!

### The applications are not meant to be difficult or competitive. Think of them more as a test to assess your level than a pass/fail exam!

### All applications are to be emailed to rithwikca2020@gmail.com
### If you are applying for the Bronze Division fill our this application:

## Program Structure
### The program will consist of units explaining concepts pertaining to the USACO Silver and Bronze Divisions. The handouts will be sorted by division. Once code solutions are submitted, they will be checked and feedback will be given. On top of this, monthly lectures will be hosted for select handouts (based on participant interest).
### Handouts will start off with setting groundwork by explaining the concepts simply and then will go on to more complex uses of the concepts. The second part will include different tricks/uses that the writers have seen in past contests! At the end, there will be a problemset with a set pass mark. That is, to "pass" the handout, you need to answer a certain number of questions!

## Cost
### In the ongoing effort to make ZACOW accessible, it is currently free. Donations are accepted, however!
